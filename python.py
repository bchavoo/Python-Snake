    Python Game

    This is the begining of my small project I will be working on.
    I want to develop a small game of snake, called "Python".
    This will help me review and refamilarize myself with Python language,
    such as simple logic and object movement.

class snake(object):
    def __init__(self, color, pos):
        pass

    def move(self):
        pass

    def reset(self, pos):
        pass

    def addCube(self):
        pass
